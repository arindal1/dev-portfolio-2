## Note:
*This is a personal project, and isn't meant to imitate anyone else's work, any similarities found can be purely coincidental. This repo is meant to be an upgraded version of my old [portfolio](https://github.com/arindal1/portfolio-website) site with more fun features, animations and UI optimizations. I just like developing, and this was purely for fun. If you like my landing page, feel free to draw inspiration or re-use elements from it.*
